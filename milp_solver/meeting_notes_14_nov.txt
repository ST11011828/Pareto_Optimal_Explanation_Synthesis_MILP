Add comments with specific examples used for testing
Run on different datasets and calculate the time taken

2 goals-
1. Find an upper bound of the pareto curve
2. Make appropriate changes in the encoding so that the process scales


Root has to be binary lam and tau of everything else is continuous
Tau and lam of root is binary lam of everything else binary tau continuous
root+one node connected to it binary
Different ways to explore the space are going to be an upper bound

Create a directory with test cases
Allow more flexibility in relaxation - find out the variables that hit hard when made binary(find experimentally)
talk to Aniruddha about sat check and combining both the approaches.
Write the approaches discussed today properly so that we can discuss with. others
